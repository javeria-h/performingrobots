Plot:

D.O.T., a farming robot, gets transported to the Land of Oz by a storm. Along the way, she meets Rust, Cogs,Vee and Echo—each searching for something they believe only "The Great Wizard" can give them. Together, they face the challenges set by the Wicked AI of the West, using their unique strengths to get through. But when they finally reach the Wizard, they find out it's just an outdated, malfunctioning AI that can't actually grant their wishes. Instead, they realize the power has been within them all along. With this new understanding, they defeat the Wicked AI, freeing themselves and other robots from its control. In the end, they discover that their "malfunctions" were actually signs of free will—something all robots have, but were programmed to ignore. Their journey was really about realizing they themselves had the power to change their fate all along.
