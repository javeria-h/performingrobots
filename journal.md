## Robot: Miss Scarlet
### Trope:
*Femme Fatale</br>* 

- Glamorous and cunning, Miss Scarlet uses her charm and sharp wit to manipulate others while keeping her own secrets guarded. She thrives on drama and intrigue, with a knack for getting people to reveal their weaknesses.
- Known for her confidence and style, she is always dressed in striking reds, catching the eye of anyone in the room.
- Behind her composed and charming exterior lies a fiercely ambitious personality willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead.
- She’s quick with a retort or her charismatic smile to deflect suspicion and stay one step ahead.


## Outfit & Style:
### Dress:  
- Miss Scarlet can be dressed in a sleek, form-fitting red dress (made from fabric or painted cardboard) to match her signature color. Flowing fabric would accentuate her dramatic and eye-catching style.
### Accessories:
- Long red gloves and a feathered red hat or maybe a hairpiece to give her a sense of elegance.
- A pearl necklace or sparkling jewelry to emphasize her wealth and refinement.
- High heels that could be sculpted to maintain her poised stance.
### Physical Appearance:
- Sharp Features: Her face could be made with defined, angular shapes to give her a fierce and striking appearance.
- Eyes could be enhanced with glowing LEDs to symbolize her sharp wit. 
- A coy smile or lips painted red to show her manipulation and charm.
- Long, flowing,hair (made of yarn or perhaps just a wig) in a dark color, with streaks for added flair.
### Special Features:
- Fan for Dramatic Wind: A small hidden fan could blow air at her hair or dress for that dramatic “movie moment” effect.
- Hidden Compartments: Since she thrives on secrets, we could maybe design a secret compartment within her base or outfit, which could open to reveal a hidden object (perhaps a lipstick or a secret note?).
- Movable Arms: Has flexible, jointed arms that can be posed in a dramatic way, perhaps holding a fan or something to add to her persona.
### Additional Features:
- Smoke Effect: She could have a mini fog or smoke machine to create a sense of mystery when she moves or speaks.
- Eyes or Jewelry that Light Up: LED-enhanced earrings or bracelets that glow when she’s engaged in "manipulation," or perhaps glowing eyes that shift colors to show her thinking or scheming.

On Thursday, we worked on building the base of our robot. We started by extending the motor wires, soldering additional wire to make them longer. After we finished soldering the wires, we moved on to the wheels. The first step here was attaching the rubber tires to the plastic wheels. Once we had the wheels ready, we used hubs to attach the motors to them. We also applied brackets to the motors, which helped secure them to the base later. After that, we assembled the plastic wheels onto the motors, fastening everything with nuts, bolts and washers. Using a screwdriver, we tightened everything down to ensure a solid connection between the motors and the wheels. We double checked all the screws and bolts to make sure nothing was loose before moving on.

With the motors and wheels assembled, we started planning how everything would fit onto the baseboard. We took careful measurements, finding the center of the board and positioning the motor-powered wheels on either side for balance. The regular wheels were positioned at the top and bottom of the board to provide extra stability and support for the structure. Once we had everything mapped out, I drilled the hole in the center of the board as the first step in securing the wheels to the base. There are still a few more holes to drill before we can fully attach the wheels, but we made solid progress in mapping out and preparing for the next steps. The remaining holes will be drilled soon, and then we’ll be able to attach the wheels securely to the base.

This week, after drilling the four holes to attach each motor bracket to the wood board, we secured the motors using M4 nuts and 30mm bolts. We made sure everything was aligned correctly before fastening, using a screwdriver and a socket wrench to tighten everything down. The bolts were 30mm long, so they provided a secure fit and we ensured the motors were attached firmly enough to stay stable when the robot moves.

Next, we focused on the caster wheels. Since the robot needs to move freely, we cut a piece of wood into two and then attached those small wooden blocks to the board first and then mounted the caster wheels onto the block. This setup allows the board to have the flexibility and "wiggle" needed for maneuverability, rather than being overly stable, so the robot can turn and move smoothly. Without this flexibility, the base would be too rigid, making navigation difficult. 

After finalizing the wheel setup, we moved on to the battery attachment process. We chose the middle-left side of the board as the best spot to mount the battery because it would balance the weight and leave enough space for the other components. We drilled four holes around this area and secured the battery in place using zip ties. The zip ties gave it a snug fit but also allow for easy adjustments if needed later on.

# Questions for Presentations 
1. If we embraced the fact that robots aren't human and stopped trying to make them look realistic, could they offer new ways of engaging audiences in performance—perhaps through more abstract or futuristic storytelling techniques?
2. When watching a robot perform, do you think the audience’s knowledge that it’s a machine impacts how they feel about the performance? Would the emotional impact be different if they didn’t know it was a robot?

This week was all about getting the motor and Arduino mounted on the base and wiring everything together. We started by attaching the motor and Arduino (with the motor shield) to the base, and to keep things secure, we drilled two diagonal holes underneath the Arduino and motor shield and screwed them in place. It was a bit tricky to get the placement right, but it feels solid now.

Next up was soldering. We soldered wires and header pins to the L298 board (which is the motor controller), then soldered header pins to the Arduino shield. After that, we moved on to soldering the wires from the L298 board to the Hobby RC and Motor Controller. It took some time, but the connections look clean.

Once we were sure everything was set up properly, we secured all the boards onto the base.

Finally, we worked on wiring the motors. We had to unscrew a few things to get the motor connections sorted out, but eventually, we wired the motors to the L298 H-Bridge and connected the H-Bridge to the battery.

Now that everything is secured and wired up, the next step is testing the motor connections to make sure it all works as planned.

So we were thinking that our robot, Miss Scarlet, is going to have OLED eyes that can blink and widen to give her some expression. We’re also planning to add servo motors for her eyebrows so they can raise and lower—this will help her show emotions like surprise or curiosity. The face will probably be made from carton, which is light but sturdy enough to hold everything in place.

We’ll build the skeleton (basically the body) out of wood or another strong but lightweight material to support the motors, wires and battery. She’s going to wear an elaborate red party dress to give her a grand, stylish look. For the arms, we’ll use servo motors at the shoulders to give her some movement and the hands will be made from rubber gloves stuffed with cotton balls to keep them soft and flexible.

For that extra dramatic flair, we want her to hold a fan. So, for the fan mechanism, we’re planning to place a small motor in the wrist that will control the opening and closing of the fan, adding some cool movement and interaction to her character.
