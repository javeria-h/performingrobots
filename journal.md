##Robot: Miss Scarlet
###Trope:
* Femme Fatale</br>*
Glamorous and cunning, Miss Scarlet uses her charm and sharp wit to manipulate others while keeping her own secrets guarded. She thrives on drama and intrigue, with a knack for getting people to reveal their weaknesses.
Known for her confidence and style, she is always dressed in striking reds, catching the eye of anyone in the room.
Behind her composed and charming exterior lies a fiercely ambitious personality willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead.
 She’s quick with a retort or her charismatic smile to deflect suspicion and stay one step ahead.


Outfit & Style:
Elegant Dress:  Miss Scarlet can be dressed in a sleek, form-fitting red dress (made from fabric or painted cardboard) to match her signature color. Flowing fabric would accentuate her dramatic and eye-catching style.
Accessories:
Long red gloves and a feathered red hat or maybe a hairpiece to give her a sense of elegance.
A pearl necklace or sparkling jewelry to emphasize her wealth and refinement.
High heels that could be sculpted to maintain her poised stance.
Physical Appearance:
Sharp Features: Her face could be made with defined, angular shapes to give her a fierce and striking appearance.
Eyes could be enhanced with glowing LEDs to symbolize her sharp wit 
A coy smile or lips painted red to show her manipulation and charm.
Hair: Long ,flowing,hair (made of yarn or wig material) in a dark color, with streaks for added flair.
Special Features:
Fan for Dramatic Wind: A small hidden fan could blow air at her hair or dress for that dramatic “movie moment” effect.
Voice Activation: She could deliver sweet and smooth lines or clever retorts using a simple voice module.
Hidden Compartments: Since she thrives on secrets,we could maybe design a secret compartment within her base or outfit, which could open to reveal a hidden object (perhaps a lipstick or a secret note?).
Movable Arms: Has flexible, jointed arms that can be posed in a dramatic way, perhaps holding a fan or something to add to her persona.
Accessories:
Smoke Effect: Similar to Professor Plum, she could have a mini fog or smoke machine to create a sense of mystery when she moves or speaks.
Eyes or Jewelry that Light Up: LED-enhanced earrings or bracelets that glow when she’s engaged in "manipulation," or perhaps glowing eyes that shift colors to show her thinking or scheming.
